### Descriptive analysis
1. Which are the months with the highest sales?
2. Which are the cities with the top sales?
3. What products sold the most?
### Exploratory analysis
4. What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
5. What products are most often sold together?

## Libraries & Modules 
pandas, numpy, os, itertools, collections, matplotlib

## Skills
-  Extensive data cleaning, manipulation and modeling using loops and lambda.
